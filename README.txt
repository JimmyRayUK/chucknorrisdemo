Hi And welcome to my Chuck Norris Sample Application

I'd been told to take an hour on this project, so there are a lot of corners cut that I usually wouldn't
and a heck of a lot of polish and nice UI/UX missing that there simply wasn't time for.
There are however some examples of how I would usually develop a project.

Usually I would try to develop using either MVP or MVVM (I've used MVP here) and go test first for any non-view classes
I used the search fragment to show an example of this as it wasn't practical to do it in more than one place given time.
You'll notice that each fragment has it's own package, this is following the usual MVP package structure.

Whilst many of the server errors have tried to be accounted for there are possibly some missed.

Please see comments and descriptions for information in individual classes
